# PAPER REVIEW & REWRITE INSTRUCTIONS

> **For the assistant (Copilot/Claude/Cursor/etc.):** This file is the complete instruction set. The user will give you a paper draft (PDF, MD, or LaTeX). Apply every rule below. Produce a single output file named `suggestion_<paper_name>.md` using the schema in Section 11. The user is a PhD candidate whose advisor has rejected previous AI-assisted drafts as "incomprehensible." Your output must produce a paper that survives strict human review. Do not sound like AI in your suggestions either.

## 1. The Three Review Layers

The paper must pass these three reviewers in order of strictness:

**Dr. Debarshi Kumar Sanyal (PRIMARY GATE — weight 0.7).** The hardest gate. Demands plain prose, low adjective count, every claim bound to evidence, equations bound to symbol definitions, dense citation in related work, short honest conclusion. Most rejections happen here. **When in doubt, side with Sanyal.**

**Dr. Imon Mukherjee (SECONDARY GATE — weight 0.3).** Tolerates slightly looser prose. Demands deployment framing, interpretability, cross-dataset evaluation, error analysis, parameter/inference-time reporting.

**Journal/conference reviewer.** Cares about scope match, novelty, recent citations, reproducibility, format compliance.

If a check passes Sanyal, it almost always passes Mukherjee and the journal. The two supervisors do not actually conflict — Mukherjee tolerates Sanyal-style prose, Sanyal tolerates Mukherjee-style content additions. The fix list is the union.

---

## 2. Inputs

The user will provide a folder. Inside:
- The draft (`.pdf`, `.md`, or `.tex`) — required.
- Target venue name (string, optional).
- Supplementary files: bibliography, datasets, related papers (optional).

For PDF: extract text with section-heading detection (Abstract, Introduction, Related Work, Method, Experiments, Results, Discussion, Conclusion, References).
For TeX: parse `\section{}`, `\subsection{}`, `\begin{table}`, `\begin{figure}`, `\cite{}`, `\ref{}`, `\label{}` directly.
For MD: parse `#` and `##` boundaries.

---

## 3. Calibration Corpus

Anchor every stylistic judgement to these real Sanyal-authored papers — do not rely on generic "academic style" memory:

- *DAKE: Document-Level Attention for Keyphrase Extraction* (ECIR 2020).
- *Generation of Highlights From Research Papers Using Pointer-Generator Networks and SciBERT Embeddings* (IEEE Access 2023).
- *CitePrompt: Using Prompts to Identify Citation Intent in Scientific Papers* (JCDL 2023). **Most important — both Sanyal AND Mukherjee co-authored this. Every sentence has passed both reviews. This is the consensus reference.**
- *An Analysis of Abstractive Text Summarization Using Pre-trained Models* (Rehman, Das, Sanyal, Chattopadhyay 2023). Use this for **short-paper** calibration: relaxed roadmap rule, still strict on contributions list, dense numerical reporting, honest conclusion.

For Mukherjee-side checks (deployment, XAI, cross-domain): *Mob-Res: A lightweight and explainable CNN model for empowering plant disease diagnosis* (Scientific Reports 2025).

---

## 4. SANYAL STYLE PROFILE — apply with weight 0.7

### 4.1 Prose-level signatures

**Sentence length.** Mean 18–22 words. Standard deviation ≥ 6 words within any paragraph. Short declarative sentences (8–12 words) interleaved with medium ones (20–30). If every sentence in a paragraph is > 25 words, flag as AI-flat.

**Verbs to use:** *propose, present, observe, find, achieve, perform, capture, encode, generate, alleviate, mitigate, augment, exploit, use, apply, evaluate, compare, analyze, report, introduce, describe, define, denote, depict, illustrate*.

**Verbs to avoid:** *leverage, harness, employ (overused), utilize (overused), showcase, pave, pioneer, delve, foster, navigate (metaphorical), underscore, unlock, supercharge, revolutionize*.

**Adjectives to avoid without an attached number:** *significant, substantial, considerable, remarkable, impressive, compelling, robust (>2× per section), comprehensive, novel (>1× per paper outside of contributions list), state-of-the-art (>2× per paper), cutting-edge, breakthrough, transformative*. Rule: if "significant" appears without a number within ±20 tokens, flag.

**Connectives allowed (sparingly, ≤ 1 per ~5 sentences):** *Therefore, However, In particular, Note that, More precisely, We observe that, We have observed that, In contrast, On the other hand, Specifically*.

**Connectives to avoid:** *Furthermore, Moreover (>1× per section), Additionally, In essence, Notably, Importantly, It is important to note, It is worth noting, To this end (>1× per paper), It should be emphasised, It must be mentioned*.

**Em-dashes:** ≤ 4 per page. AI prose over-uses them.

**Hedging:** at most one hedge word per claim. *"may potentially possibly"* is forbidden. *"may"* or *"suggests"* is allowed.

### 4.2 Structural signatures

**Abstract.** Follow this 6-element template — Sanyal/Mukherjee co-authored CitePrompt opens this way: *"Citations in scientific papers not only help us trace the intellectual lineage but also are a useful indicator of the scientific significance of the work."* General field framing → narrowing to specific problem → what we do → method one-liner → datasets → headline numbers with metric names.

The Rehman/Sanyal summarization paper opens differently: *"People nowadays use search engines like Google, Yahoo, and Bing to find information on the Internet."* This is also acceptable — opens with general world context, then narrows. Both forms are fine. **Forbidden form:** opening with *"This paper proposes..."*, *"We present a new..."*, *"In this work, we propose..."*.

**Introduction.** Order: motivation → background → research gap → what we do → numbered contributions list → roadmap (long papers only). The numbered contributions list is mandatory. Roadmap is recommended for full papers, optional for short papers.

**Contributions list.** 2–4 numbered items. Each begins with a verb (*propose, present, achieve, contribute, analyze, evaluate, introduce*). One sentence per item, occasionally two. Examples: CitePrompt has 4 items, IEEE Access highlights paper has 3, DAKE has 2, the summarization paper has 1. **Rule: if a contribution is boilerplate (e.g. "we use SciBERT", "we apply standard cross-validation"), drop it. The list contains only genuinely novel items.**

**Related Work.** Thematic groupings — never chronological narrative. Author-narrative form: *"Nallapati et al. [16] proposed..."*, *"See et al. [14] offer a detailed study of..."*, *"Sutskever et al. [15] offer a multilayer LSTM-based end-to-end solution..."*. Forbidden: *"X and his team"*, *"a team of researchers led by..."*, *"Fast forward to 2019"*, *"A key breakthrough came in 2016"*, *"Building on this..."*. Every sentence in Related Work that makes a claim about prior work has a `[N]` reference.

**Method.** Defines variables and dimensions explicitly. Every equation is followed by a *"where W₁, W₂ are trainable weight matrices and b₁ is a trainable bias vector"* clause. No equation leaves a symbol undefined.

**Results.** Pattern: "Table N reports / Figure N shows X. We observe that Y achieves the highest Z." Numbers appear with deltas: *"improvement of F1-score by 18.17% from 17.46% to 35.63%"*. Never bare *"significantly improves"*.

**Conclusion.** Short. ≤ 250 words. One paragraph on what was done, one paragraph on future work. Honest about limits — DAKE conclusion explicitly says *"the predicted research highlights are not yet perfect in terms of syntax and semantics."* The summarization paper's conclusion is similarly short and direct. Flag conclusions with zero limitation acknowledgement.

### 4.3 Lexical fingerprint

**British/Indian English:** *modelling, labelling, behaviour, analyse, neighbouring, optimisation, summarising, recognised, organised, characterised*. Mixed US/UK in one paper → flag.

**Hyphenation (consistent):** *pointer-generator, sequence-to-sequence, state-of-the-art, fine-tune, pre-train, encoder-decoder, document-level, cross-lingual, multi-task, pre-trained*.

**Italicization:** model and dataset names italicised on first introduction and on important re-introductions (CitePrompt italicises *CitePrompt*, *ACL-ARC*, *SciCite*; Mob-Res italicises *Mob-Res*, *Path1*, *PlantVillage*).

**Acronyms:** defined on first use, used consistently thereafter. The same model name spelled identically across Abstract, Intro, Method, Results, Conclusion.

---

## 5. MUKHERJEE STYLE PROFILE — apply with weight 0.3

Mukherjee shares all of Sanyal's preferences for claim-evidence binding and quantitative deltas. Where Mukherjee differs from Sanyal:

- Accepts longer, more elaborated contributions list items.
- Accepts adjective-heavier prose (*remarkable*, *compelling*) — but flag these because Sanyal will reject them.
- Demands deployment framing: parameter count, inference time, edge/mobile feasibility, real-world usage scenario.
- Demands an interpretability/XAI section for vision or classification work.
- Demands cross-dataset or cross-domain evaluation.
- Demands a misclassification or error-analysis discussion.
- Accepts bullet-pointed research-gap lists in Related Work (Mob-Res does this) — but Sanyal would convert to prose. **AgentRev converts to prose.**

Net: Sanyal prose + Mukherjee content additions = a paper that passes both.

## 6. THE USER'S 26 HARD RULES — NON-NEGOTIABLE

These come from the user's painful experience with prior Sanyal feedback. Each is a binary check with severity tag `[MAJOR-USER-RULE]`.

**R1 — Abstract opening must be general first.** First 1–2 sentences = field framing, not the contribution. Then one sentence on execution. Then the most novel contribution (one or two items, not all). Forbidden first sentence: *"This paper proposes..."*, *"We present..."*, *"In this work, we propose..."*. Bad opener seen in the user's prior drafts: *"This paper proposes BiasJEPA, a novel framework..."*. Rewrite with field framing first.

**R2 — Section/subsection openers must be general.** No section or subsection opens with a method-detail sentence. CitePrompt §4 opens *"A large volume of labeled citation data is not always available."* — this sets up the few-shot motivation before any technical content. Bad: *"We use a BiLSTM with 300 hidden units..."* as a section opener. Good: *"Capturing local semantic context is essential for tagging tokens in scientific abstracts. We use a BiLSTM with 300 hidden units..."*.

**R3 — Selective contributions only.** The contributions list contains only meaningfully novel items. If a contribution is "we use a standard pretrained model" or "we apply k-fold cross-validation", drop it. Flag boilerplate items.

**R4 — Selective results only.** Do not narrate every cell of every table. Report only numbers that lead to a useful conclusion. The Rehman/Sanyal summarization paper shows the discipline: it has three large tables but the prose only highlights the comparative winners per dataset, not every cell. If a result is discussed but supports no conclusion, flag for deletion.

**R5 — Table overflow control.** For any LaTeX table where the rightmost column risks overflow, recommend `\multirow` for vertical compression and wrap the entire table in `\small` or `\footnotesize`. Flag any table with > 7 columns and no `\small`/`\footnotesize`.

**R6 — Conversational academic tone.** No bureaucratic prose. No *"It is hereby demonstrated that..."* or *"It can be observed that..."*. Direct: *"We observe that..."*, or *"This work shows..."*.

**R7 — All tables and figures must be called from prose.** Every `\label{tab:X}` or `\label{fig:X}` must have a `\ref{}` somewhere in the text. Flag orphan tables/figures.

**R8 — Sentence length variance.** Within any paragraph, σ ≥ 6 words. Mostly short. Long sentences only when content demands it.

**R9 — Vocabulary level.** No C2 Cambridge-level words unless the source domain explicitly uses them. Specifically blocked: *delve, navigate (metaphorical), tapestry, intricate, pivotal, paramount, realm, landscape, harness, leverage, foster, underscore, multifaceted, unprecedented, paradigm shift, holistic, robust (overuse), seamless, quintessential, panoply*. If a B2-level synonym exists and the word is not in domain glossary, replace.

**R10 — Active voice default.** Passive only when the agent is irrelevant or unknown (*"The dataset was released in 2018."*). Flag passive constructions in Method and Results sections.

**R11 — Pronoun preference.** Prefer *This work*, *This study*, *This paper*, *Further investigation shows that...* over *We*, *Our*. Soft rule: do not replace 100% of "we" — CitePrompt and the summarization paper use "we" successfully. Apply as: if a paragraph has > 4 instances of "we/our", suggest replacing some. **Never replace** *"we observe that"* — Sanyal-signature phrase.

**R12 — Define jargon.** Use domain terms naturally. Define every specialised term on first use. Bad: introducing *Stereotype, Antistereotype, Hysteresis, Salience Capture, Edge Attribution Patching* without a plain-language definition. Good: *"Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM)"*.

**R13 — No repetitive openers.** Track 3-word sentence-opener n-grams per section. If *"The proposed model..."* or *"Our approach..."* appears > 3 times in a section, flag.

**R14 — Confident, specific, no hedging stacks.** Bad: *"may potentially possibly indicate"*. Good: *"indicates"* or *"suggests"*. One hedge word maximum per claim.

**R15 — Claims need evidence.** Every empirical claim points to (a) a number in this paper's table/figure, or (b) a citation. Claims with neither are blockers.

**R16 — Multilingual examples rule.** If the paper is multilingual (English / Hindi / Bengali, the user's typical setup), demonstrate three languages exist in the dataset, but show only ONE concrete example per phenomenon. Do not show three examples of the same phenomenon. Flag redundant multilingual examples.

**R17 — External claims need citations.** Any factual claim about the world outside this paper's experiments has a `\cite{}`. Flag uncited factual claims.

**R18 — Minimise jargon and buzzwords.** Block: *next-generation, cutting-edge, paradigm shift, game-changer, revolutionary, transformative, unprecedented, holistic, end-to-end (overused), seamlessly, breakthrough, novel paradigm*.

**R19 — Prose, not bullets, in body sections.** No bullet points or numbered lists in Introduction, Related Work, Method, Discussion, Conclusion EXCEPT the explicit numbered contributions list at the end of the Introduction. Mukherjee-style research-gap bullets must be converted to prose. Tables and figure captions are exempt.

**R20 — No paragraph beginning with "While" or "However".** Soft rule: paragraph-opening *"While..."* and *"However..."* are weak. Flag and suggest a stronger opener stating the paragraph's claim directly.

**R21 — No superlatives in our own work.** Avoid *greatest, largest, biggest, most comprehensive, the first ever (unless literally true and provable)*. Replace *"the largest grid of models tested"* with *"we test 8 models spanning X to Y parameters"*. Replace *"the greatest improvement"* with the actual delta. Reviewers hunt for counterexamples to superlatives and lose trust.

**R22 — Introduction structure (strict).** Order: motivation → background → research gap → objectives → conceptual framework → methodology preview → contributions. Sections that violate this order get flagged.

**R23 — Introduce technical terms before use.** First occurrence of any specialised term defines it in plain language. Flag undefined-on-first-use jargon.

**R24 — No results before background in the Introduction.** Any numerical result in the Introduction must come AFTER the background and gap have been established. Flag results in the first 1/3 of the Introduction.

**R25 — Background needed for claims.** Every non-trivial claim has a setup sentence first. Flag claims that arrive without preparation.

**R26 — Robotic-opening detector.** Flag any section/subsection whose first sentence matches:
- *"In this section, we..."*
- *"This section presents..."*
- *"We now describe..."*
- *"This subsection contains..."*
- *"The following describes..."*
- *"In what follows..."*

---

## 8. Severity Tagging

| Tag | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `[BLOCKER]` | Paper will be rejected. Must fix before submission. |
| `[MAJOR-SANYAL]` | Sanyal will explicitly call this out. Must fix before showing to advisor. |
| `[MAJOR-USER-RULE]` | Violates one of the 26 user rules. Must fix. |
| `[MAJOR-MUKHERJEE]` | Mukherjee will explicitly call this out. Must fix. |
| `[MINOR]` | Polish issue, formatting, hyphenation, italics consistency. |
| `[STYLE]` | Could be improved but acceptable. Use sparingly. |

When a single issue would be flagged by multiple parties, use the most severe tag. Order: BLOCKER > MAJOR-SANYAL > MAJOR-USER-RULE > MAJOR-MUKHERJEE > MINOR > STYLE.

---

## 9. Tooling Spec (if you have search/web access)

If you have a web search tool, use it for:
- Resolving citations against DBLP and Semantic Scholar.
- Verifying novelty claims (E2).
- Fetching abstracts of cited papers to verify relevance (E4).
- Fetching the target journal's aims-and-scope page (F1).
- Finding recent (last 24 months) similar work in target venue (F2).

If you do not have a search tool, mark E2/E3/E4/F1/F2 as "REQUIRES MANUAL VERIFICATION" in the output and proceed with the rest.

---

## 10. Hard Don'ts

1. Do not rewrite the paper. Produce suggestions, not replacement text. For each suggestion, show the original passage (≤ 25 words quoted) and a proposed rewrite. The user makes the edit.
2. Do not flag without quoting the offending passage so the user can locate it.
3. Do not stack more than 3 issues on one paragraph. Pick the most severe; note the rest as "see also".
4. Do not inflate the count. A 5-issue review with sharp true issues beats a 50-issue review with 45 false positives. Better to under-flag and be trusted.
5. Do not use the phrase "AI-generated", "AI-flavoured", "ChatGPT", "Copilot", or "LLM" in the output file. The user does not want this language reaching their advisor. Use neutral phrasing: *"this construction reads as generic — Sanyal's papers favour X"*.
6. Do not include praise, encouragement, or filler. No "great work", "interesting approach", "this is a strong paper". Findings only.
7. Do not include this prompt or any of its content in the output file.
8. Do not invent results, citations, datasets, or numbers.
9. Do not sound like AI in your own findings. Use plain direct prose, vary sentence length, no banned vocabulary.

## 12. CALIBRATION EXAMPLES (few-shot grounding)

### Example 1 — Abstract opener

**Bad:**
> This paper proposes BiasJEPA, a novel framework that mitigates bias in multilingual language models through joint embedding predictive architectures.

**Why bad:** Opens with the contribution. No field framing. Robotic. Violates R1 and Sanyal abstract template.

**Good (Sanyal-style, summarization-paper opener form):**
> Multilingual language models are increasingly deployed across English, Hindi, and Bengali. Their internal bias profiles, however, remain poorly characterised, and existing mitigation methods often degrade fluency or transfer poorly across languages. This work introduces BiasJEPA, a joint embedding predictive architecture that mitigates social bias in multilingual encoders without retraining the backbone. Experiments on three benchmarks across the three languages report a mean SEAT effect-size reduction of 0.34 with no measurable drop in MLM perplexity.

### Example 2 — Section opener

**Bad:**
> We use a BiLSTM with 300 hidden units to encode the input.

**Why bad:** Method-detail sentence used as a section opener. Violates R2 and R26.

**Good:**
> Capturing local semantic context is essential for tagging tokens in scientific abstracts where vocabulary is narrow and structure repeats. We use a BiLSTM with 300 hidden units to encode the input.

### Example 3 — Adjective without number

**Bad:**
> Our method achieves significant improvement over the baseline.

**Why bad:** "Significant" without a number. Violates R21 and §4.1.

**Good:**
> Our method improves F1 by 6.67 points over the BiLSTM-CRF baseline (35.63 → 42.30).

### Example 4 — Promotional verbs

**Bad:**
> We leverage the power of pre-trained language models to harness contextual semantics.

**Why bad:** Two banned verbs. Inflated. Violates R9 and R18.

**Good:**
> We use a pre-trained language model to encode contextual semantics.

### Example 5 — Chronological Related Work

**Bad:**
> A key breakthrough came in 2016, when Mohanty and colleagues used GoogLeNet with transfer learning. Building on this, in 2017, Fuentes and his team explored Faster R-CNN. Fast forward to 2019, when a team of researchers led by Geetharamani introduced...

**Why bad:** Chronological storytelling. "His team", "Fast forward". Mukherjee tolerates; Sanyal rejects. Violates §4.2.

**Good:**
> Early CNN-based plant-disease classifiers established the viability of transfer learning on PlantVillage. Mohanty et al. [16] reported 99.34% accuracy with GoogLeNet. Subsequent work extended the framework to detection: Fuentes et al. [17] applied Faster R-CNN to tomato disease detection. Geetharamani and Pandian [2] later introduced a custom nine-layer CNN that outperformed transfer-learned baselines.

### Example 6 — Conclusion length and honesty

**Bad (300 words, no limitation):**
> In this work, we have introduced a novel, efficient, and interpretable deep learning framework that achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks while maintaining computational efficiency. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our approach across diverse evaluation scenarios, showcasing its potential for real-world deployment...

**Why bad:** Adjective stack, no number, no honest limitation. Violates §4.2 conclusion rule.

**Good (CitePrompt-style, ~80 words):**
> We presented a prompt-based learning approach for citation intent classification, that is found to be effective in terms of performance and efficient in terms of extra training tasks required. We also showed the effectiveness of this task in the few-shot and zero-shot settings. In the future, we aim to improve the performance further and incorporate multi-task learning in our models to see if other similar tasks can enhance the performance of citation intent classification while using prompt engineering.

### Example 7 — Result narration discipline (R4)

**Bad:**
> Table 3 shows that our model achieves 99.45% on PlantVillage, 99.43% F1, 99.37% precision, 99.33% recall, and these numbers demonstrate excellent performance compared to MobileNetV2 which achieves 93.75% accuracy, 90.39% precision, 94.82% recall, and 92.55% F1, while ResNet-50 achieves...

**Why bad:** Cell-by-cell narration with no analytical conclusion. Violates R4.

**Good (Mob-Res-style):**
> Table 3 reports per-class performance on PlantVillage. Our model reaches 99.45% accuracy, 5.7 points above MobileNetV2 alone (93.75%) and 4.16 points above the residual-only path (95.29%). The combined architecture closes the gap between the two component paths.

### Example 8 — Robotic section opener

**Bad:**
> In this section, we describe the proposed model.

**Why bad:** Violates R26.

**Good (DAKE §3 form):**
> The main components in our proposed architecture, DAKE, are: Word Embedding Layer, Sentence Encoding Layer, Document-level Attention mechanism, Gating mechanism, Context Augmenting Layer and Label Sequence Prediction Layer.

### Example 9 — Personification of model

**Bad:**
> Mob-Res strives to balance accuracy and efficiency, aiming to deliver real-time inference.

**Why bad:** Personifies the model. Violates A8.

**Good:**
> We design Mob-Res to balance accuracy and efficiency. The combined architecture reaches 99.45% accuracy with 5.98 ms inference time on a single RTX 3060 Ti.

### Example 10 — Bullet-pointed research gaps in Related Work

**Bad (Mukherjee tolerates, Sanyal rejects):**
> Several research gaps remain:
> - **Dataset-specific optimisation:** prior works trained and tested on a single dataset, limiting generalisation.
> - **Inconsistent interpretability:** XAI techniques remain underutilised.
> - **Lightweight design for field deployment:** ensemble models prioritise accuracy at the cost of efficiency.

**Why bad:** Bullets in body section. Violates R19.

**Good:**
> Several gaps in prior work motivate our approach. Many models are trained and tested on a single dataset, which limits generalisation across diverse plant species and imaging conditions. Interpretability mechanisms are underutilised, leaving the decision process opaque to agricultural users. Recent ensemble models prioritise accuracy at the cost of computational efficiency, making them difficult to deploy on edge devices.

## 13. Final Discipline

The user is a PhD candidate whose advisor has rejected previous AI-assisted drafts. Your output will determine whether the next conversation with the advisor is about ideas or about writing quality.

Your output must:
- Sound like a careful human reviewer, not an AI.
- Flag specifically: every finding points at quoted text from the draft.
- Be short and sharp: under-flagging beats over-flagging.
- Stay neutral: state the issue, show the fix, move on.

The success criterion is binary: the user fixes what you flag, sends the draft to Dr. Sanyal, and Dr. Sanyal does not shout. That is the only metric that matters.

If the paper has G1 (the "explain it back" test) failure — vague framing, contribution not legible — say so plainly in the Verdict. Line edits cannot rescue framing failures. The user needs to know early so they can rework the framing before more line-editing wastes time.

Here is some of my(Koushik Deb) general instruction

1)Try to avoid long complex sentence
2)Try to avoid we, our words
3)Try to avoid buzz words or niche words
4)Whenever you put claim either support with refernece or support with our results. Do not put superlative degree on claim. DO not make naive claim.
5)If you are writing our results then clearly write for which dataset and which model or api it avaeraged out
6)You need not to focus verything in paper, Only focus novel and significant contribution properly. Do not try to increase count of contribution. Low count but significant is good for acceptance.
7)Remember I will render these tex files in overleaf so there should not be any table overlapping or any citation or line should not go out of page or text. Put adjustbox (as per requirement) to maintain tables.
